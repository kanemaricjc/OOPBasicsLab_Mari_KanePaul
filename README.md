Lab 8, to be passed to Sir Jamie Eduardo Rosal. 

### Activity 1
Student 1 can be seen in the code. I made a separate class for the Student code, seen in the student class.
### Activity 2
For Activity 2, I just made the student class private, and used setName, setAge, and setGrade to just change the names, age, and grades respectively, for comfort.
### Activity 3
For activity 3, I assigned 3 attributes, brand, model, and speed respectively. I initialized these attributes with a constructor and used two methods, which are accelerate and displayStatus. For the acceleration method, it increases the speed and for displayStatus, it prints the vehicle's details. I made two objects, named vehicle1 and vehicle2.
### Activity 4
For activity 4, I assigned 2 attributes, accountHolder, and balance respectively. I again initialized these attributes with a constructor and made 3 methods, namely deposit, withdraw and displayBalance. Deposit asks for an amount in Php and adds that amount to the existing balance, withdraw asks for an amount in Php and deducts that amount, and displayDetails displays the details of the account.
### Activity 5
For activity 5, I assigned just 1 attribute, just the radius. I again initialized these attributes with a constructor and made 3 methods, getArea, getCircumference and displayDetails. GetArea displays the area of the circle using the area formula for a circle, getCircumference displays the circumference of the circle using the circumference formula and displayDetails just displays the circle's details, including its radius, area, and circumference.
